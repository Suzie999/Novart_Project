# Novart_Project
Customer Engagement Analysis_2021

Following on from an intense bootcamp to learn Data Analytics, this is my first solo project.
As it was the first project, I tried a few ways to see how best to extract and clean the data before working on the visualisation. 
I wanted to use Big Query to practice my SQL queries and used this for the basics to see what could be used for the presentation. 

The next step was uploading the tables to PowerBi and using Power Query for further analysis and to create the visualisation and narrative.

Tools used for the project included the initial excel sheet, Big Query, Power Query and PowerBi.
